# Quality Checks

Run the production-readiness checks from this repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_quality.py
```

The validator compiles Python files, runs Ruff, parses YAML/JSON files, renders Mermaid sources when Mermaid tooling is available, runs the pipeline `--help` smoke check, runs the parser fixture suite (`tests/make_fixtures.py`, `ALL OK`), the store and onboarding suite (`tests/test_store.py`, `STORE OK`), the security regression suite (`tests/test_security.py`, `SECURITY OK`: shell syntax in paths, manifest fields, the scheduler wrapper and branding stays literal; generated pages are self-contained with a CSP), checks that the committed example pages reference nothing on the network, and checks ClawHub bundle readiness.

GitHub Actions runs the same validator on push and pull request.
