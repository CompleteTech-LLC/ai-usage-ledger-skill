# AI Usage Ledger Skill

<p align="center">

</p>

A CompleteTech LLC skill for compiling every locally recorded AI coding-agent call into one priced, account-attributed, validated ledger, kept append-only in SQLite, JSON or CSV, and rendered as a branded light/dark dashboard, a research-grade study package and fifteen ledger documents (statements, memos, briefs, billing evidence) in Markdown, HTML, PDF and DOCX. Onboard once; refresh by hand or on a schedule; keep the raw logs if you want them; anonymise for publication; ask it anything specific afterwards.

## About

Part of the CompleteTech LLC agentic services skill library. Where the `agentic-*` skills produce client-facing documents, this skill produces the evidence behind them: how much agent work happened, on which accounts, what it would have cost at list price, and what the cache and the subscriptions saved.

## What It Does

- Onboards once: brand, theme, storage backend, working directory and timezone are asked on first use (or passed as flags by an agent), stored, and never asked again; `reinit` starts over and keeps the old store.
- Labels usage by account without touching credentials unless asked: per-host placeholders by default, or the account id prefix and plan type from the tools' credential files after an explicit opt-in and a warning, with e-mails and organisation names kept only on request.
- Detects harness logs for the running OS automatically: Windows, macOS and Linux default directories, environment overrides, VS Code / Cursor / VSCodium / Windsurf global storage, every WSL distro, other user profiles and drives (same-volume mappings are recognised and skipped), plus SSH hosts you name.
- Keeps an append-only ledger in SQLite, JSON (JSONL) or CSV with stable per-call ids, so re-running never double counts and the history survives the tools' own log retention.
- Refreshes on a schedule when asked: onboarding offers daily / weekly / monthly and installs a Task Scheduler task or a crontab line that logs to the ledger home.
- Renders fifteen ledger documents from a catalog with a machine-readable index: executive summary, monthly statement, quarterly review, account statement, subscription memo, renewal recommendation, cache brief, budget forecast, project allocation, billing evidence, model mix, tool adoption, host inventory, data-quality note and correction notice, as Markdown, themed HTML, PDF and DOCX.
- Anonymises for publication: salted pseudonyms for hosts, sessions, projects and accounts; paths, prompts and identities removed; a private map kept for the owner.
- Archives the raw log files themselves when asked at onboarding: every file the scanners read, from any tool on any host kind (local, other drive, WSL, SSH), gzip by default, indexed, append-only, with `grep` and `restore`; the transcripts outlive the tools' retention windows.
- Answers detailed questions from the accumulated store: thirty presets (per day, week, month, tool, host, model, project, account, plan, session, prompt text, cache, first and last use), free read-only SQL, and regex search inside the archived logs, with date, tool, host, account, model and project filters and table / CSV / JSON output. Prompt text is stored only after an explicit opt-in (`prompts.capture=y`); by default the ledger keeps counts and tokens, and `query prompts` says so.
- Finds agent logs on every drive, user profile, WSL distro and SSH host, including old-profile backups.
- Parses Claude Code / Agent SDK, Codex CLI / Desktop / VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, opencode, OpenClaw, pi, Cline / Roo Code / Kilo Code, aider, Kimi Code CLI, Mistral Vibe and Continue with dedicated parsers, and any other JSON-logging tool through a generic usage sniffer.
- De-duplicates streamed turns and Codex fork replay (the copy of a parent's history that every spawned thread carries), which otherwise inflates totals by an order of magnitude.
- Prices every call at list API rates by token class, computes cache savings, and compares each subscription account with its API-equivalent using the billing plan Codex stamps on each call.
- Validates against the tools' own counters and states confidence per finding and per attribution rule.
- Renders a themed, brandable dashboard and a dated, checksummed study package with a machine-readable ledger.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 tests/make_fixtures.py             # must print ALL OK (the pipeline is standard library only)
python3 scripts/ledger.py init             # first use: brand, theme, sqlite/json/csv, hosts and accounts are detected
python3 scripts/ledger.py run              # scan, append new calls, rebuild dashboard and study; repeat any time
python3 scripts/ledger.py status
python3 scripts/ledger.py doc --list       # ledger documents; render one with --template <id> [--pdf --docx]
python3 scripts/ledger.py run --anonymize  # publishable copy under <workdir>/anonymized/
python3 scripts/ledger.py schedule status  # the scheduled refresh chosen at onboarding
python3 scripts/ledger.py query --presets  # then e.g. query by-project --since 2026-08-01 --tool codex
python3 scripts/ledger.py archive status   # the raw-log archive, if enabled at onboarding
```

From an agent or CI, skip the prompts: `python3 scripts/ledger.py init --yes --set brand.name=Acme --set store.kind=json`. Preferences live in `~/.ai-usage-ledger/config.json` (override with `AI_USAGE_LEDGER_HOME`); review the generated `accounts.json` there before trusting the per-account tables. `python3 scripts/ledger.py reinit` starts over and keeps the previous store beside the new one.

The manifest-driven route is still available for one-off runs without a store:

```bash
cp examples/manifest.workstation.json manifest.json      # or: python3 scripts/detect_hosts.py --all-profiles --json
cp examples/report_config.completetech.json templates/pricing.json templates/accounts.example.json .
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --manifest manifest.json
```

Rendered figures are API-equivalents at list price, not invoices. Attribution rules below high confidence are listed in the study; challenge those first.

## Example

![Dashboard preview](assets/examples/example.png)

Example files: [Onboarding transcript](assets/examples/example-onboarding.md) · [Study (Markdown)](assets/examples/example.md) · [HTML dashboard](assets/examples/example.html) · [HTML study](assets/examples/example-study.html) · [Executive summary Markdown](assets/examples/example-executive-summary.md) · [PDF](assets/examples/example.pdf) · [DOCX](assets/examples/example.docx) · [Document preview](assets/examples/example-document.png)

**Study and executive summary: synthetic fixture data across ten tools**

- Ten parsers exercised on generated logs, including a forked Codex thread whose replayed history is dropped.
- Per-account subscription versus API-equivalent, usage-based spend, and cache savings tables.
- Validation, distributions, time-of-day and concentration sections with confidence levels.
- The executive summary document rendered from the same ledger with the CompleteTech letterhead, in PDF and DOCX.
- A first-run onboarding transcript (`example-onboarding.md`) showing every question, the detection output and the saved preferences, generated by `tests/make_onboarding_example.py` on a synthetic machine.

![Executive summary preview](assets/examples/example-document.png)

Generate them:

```bash
python3 tests/make_fixtures.py
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --manifest examples/manifest.fixtures.json
python3 scripts/render_ledger_doc.py --template executive-summary \
  --compiled tests/out/pipeline/compiled --report-config examples/report_config.completetech.json \
  --var prepared_for="Finance" --out assets/examples/example-executive-summary.md --pdf --docx --png   # then rename to example.pdf / example.docx / example-document.png
```

The committed examples use synthetic fixture data only; no real account or transcript is included.

## Branding Assets

`assets/logo.png` is the CompleteTech LLC logo used on the dashboard and study headers, on the HTML band of every ledger document, and in the PDF / DOCX letterhead, whenever the `completetech` preset is selected. Out of the box the skill renders neutral, unbranded pages. `examples/report_config.completetech.json` carries the palette (`#1E3A8A` accent, `#0F172A` ink, `#EEF2FF` soft accent, `#64748B` muted, `#E2E8F0` border, `#F8FAFC` zebra), eyebrow, tagline and footer used across the skill library; onboarding offers these as defaults and stores whatever the operator answers instead. Both pages render in light, dark and system themes with a persisted toggle, starting from the theme chosen at onboarding. They are self-contained: the logo is inlined, fonts fall back to locally installed faces or the system stack, and nothing is fetched from the network.

## Data Collected

- Read: agent transcripts, session logs and the tools' own counters and databases in your own profile (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, IDE `globalStorage` and the other roots in `references/harness-catalog.md`); other profiles and drives, WSL distros and SSH hosts only when you enable `detect.all_profiles` / `detect.wsl` or name the host, and only where you own the data or are authorised to audit it. Nothing is modified and nothing needs elevation.
- Kept: an append-only ledger of per-call metadata (timestamps, models, token counts, list prices, host, project path, session id, pseudonymous account) in `~/.ai-usage-ledger/` (owner-only) plus the generated tables, dashboard, study package and documents under your working directory. Nothing is transmitted; the scripts make no network calls.
- Opt-in only: prompt text (`prompts.capture`), credential-file claims for account ids and plan types (`accounts.from_credentials`), e-mails and organisation names (`accounts.identifiable`), a copy of the raw log files (`archive.raw_logs`), and a scheduled refresh (`schedule install`, with its own typed consent). All default off.
- Sharing: build the anonymised copy (`ledger.py run --anonymize`, `doc --anonymize`) and run `ledger.py publish-check <dir>` before anything leaves the machine; it flags e-mails, account ids, organisation and host names and credential references.
- Removal: `ledger.py schedule remove`, then delete `~/.ai-usage-ledger/` and the generated directories under the working directory; `ledger.py reinit` starts a fresh configuration and keeps the previous store beside it. The full operator disclosure the agent relays before onboarding is the **Before You Start** table in `SKILL.md`.

## Security Model

- Configuration files (manifest, config, accounts, pricing, report config) are trusted input that names hosts to reach and text to render; keep them owner-writable (the scripts warn otherwise).
- No shell is ever handed a string: local commands are argument lists, the CSV merge sort is Python, and every word sent to an SSH or WSL shell is validated against a strict grammar and quoted (`scripts/safety.py`).
- Persistence is never registered by onboarding or by a configuration key: `schedule install` shows the wrapper, the hosts and roots it will read, the archive and anonymise flags, the output directories and the storage used so far, then needs a typed confirmation (a second one for high-impact schedules) or an operator-written consent record tied to a hash of that exact configuration; `--expires` makes the entry remove itself; `schedule remove` is printed everywhere it matters.
- The scheduler wrapper carries fixed flags only, is written with mode 0700 on POSIX, and its contents are printed before anything is registered.
- Branding is HTML-escaped and validated; logos are inlined from local files; generated pages carry a Content-Security-Policy and load nothing from the network unless `allow_external_resources` is set.
- Reports are neutral unless the operator chooses branding (a preset must be selected explicitly); an unconfigured `run` refuses rather than onboarding with defaults.
- Everything the ledger keeps about its owner (config, store, archive, logs, anonymisation map) is created owner-only, and a config file others can edit is refused.
- The raw-log archive validates host names and source paths, keeps every destination inside its root, and reaches SSH hosts with fixed commands fed a NUL-delimited file list.
- Credential files are opened only when the operator opts in at onboarding, after a warning that names the files and fields; only the claims needed for attribution and pricing are kept, pseudonymously unless identifiable output is requested. `accounts.json` stays owner-only and out of study packages unless asked, and `ledger.py publish-check` scans anything about to be shared for e-mails, account ids, organisation names, host names and credential references.
- `tests/test_security.py` keeps these properties under regression; the ClawHub audit findings for 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 are addressed in 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.

## Brand Notes

Use a direct, concrete, low-hype tone. Present figures as measured evidence with stated confidence: what was scanned, what was excluded, which rules are inferred. Do not present API-equivalents as invoices, do not smooth over corrections, and do not quote vendor dashboards that include replayed history as independent confirmation.

## Runtime Permissions

| Capability | Boundary |
|---|---|
| Files read | Agent transcripts, tool databases and credential files under the operator's own profiles and manifest hosts; bundled templates, references, `assets/logo.png`. |
| Files written | `~/.ai-usage-ledger/` (config, store, generated manifest, accounts, pricing, report config, private anonymisation map, scheduler wrapper and logs, and the raw-log archive when enabled); `scans/`, `compiled/`, `store-export/`, `reports/`, `anonymized/`, `documents/` under the chosen `workdir`; test fixtures during the test suites. |
| Local commands | `python3` scripts; `wsl.exe -l -q` during detection; `wsl.exe`, `ssh`, `scp` only for hosts in the manifest; `schtasks` / `crontab` only for `schedule install|remove`. |
| Not required | Outbound network access, credential use, persistence, privilege escalation, destructive file operations, background services. |

## Network Boundary

This skill is local-only. The scripts make no outbound network calls and post no metadata anywhere; SSH and WSL are reached only for hosts the operator names. Generated pages are self-contained and carry a `Content-Security-Policy` that forbids network loads; only if the operator sets `branding.allow_external_resources: true` can a rendered page reference a remote logo or Google Fonts stylesheet, which the viewer's browser then fetches.
